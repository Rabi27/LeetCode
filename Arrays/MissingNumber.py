Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 4:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

Solution with Gauss Formula
One of the most well-known stories in mathematics is of a young Gauss, forced to find the sum of the first 100 natural numbers by a lazy teacher. Rather than add the numbers by hand, he deduced a closed-form expression for the sum, or so the story goes. You can see the formula below:

Sigma Notion = n(n+1)/2

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        expectedsum = len(nums)*(len(nums)+1)//2
        actualsum = sum(nums)
        
        return expectedsum - actualsum
